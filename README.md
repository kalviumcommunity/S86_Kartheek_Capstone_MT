# Capstone Project 
 Capstone Project Plan –  MT (Mother’sTastyfood)


 Introduction
MT Foods is a full-stack food delivery platform that connects home chefs (like mothers, grandmothers, and home-based cooks) with users who crave healthy, home-cooked meals. Unlike mainstream platforms like Swiggy or Zomato, Home Foods focuses on providing nutritious, affordable, and culturally rooted meals directly from kitchens of everyday people.
The app allows home chefs to upload menus, manage orders, and earn from their culinary skills. Customers can browse daily menus, place orders, and even subscribe to regular tiffin services.

 Objective
The objective of this project is to:
Build a real-world, end-to-end food delivery platform.


Learn and demonstrate core full-stack development skills.


Showcase proof of work aligned with capstone Level 1 & Level 2 concepts.


Deliver and deploy a fully functioning app used by real users.
